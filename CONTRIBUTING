Contributing to Eclipse Platform
================================

This project, eclipse.news, is a special case, in that it is for
committers to contribute "New and Noteworthy" descriptions. 

If you think something should be in the "New and Noteworthy" that is not, 
or if you want to fix a typo, or similar, feel free to open a bug for the respective component.
